<p><strong>About Us:</strong>
Strategen maps team skills, instantly assembles the right <em>tiger team</em> for any initiative, and guides targeted upskilling—cutting delivery time <strong>up to 50%</strong>, reducing burnout, and strengthening succession.</p>
<p><strong>What we do:</strong>
Most teams don’t have a clear, current picture of their real capabilities. Strategen runs a fast Team Strength Analysis to reveal who can do what, where the coverage gaps are, and how work should be staffed. With one click, managers form <em>tiger teams</em> optimized for the mission, while recruiting gets precise role specs and employees get personalized learning paths based on goals they set.</p>
<p><strong>The result:</strong> faster delivery, smarter hiring, visible growth opportunities, and a more resilient organization.</p>
<p><strong>Core outcomes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Launch initiatives faster—often <strong>up to 50%</strong> shorter cycle times.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Exact skill coverage and role fit for every project.</li>
<li><strong>Growth:</strong> Targeted learning plans and employee-driven interests.</li>
<li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Succession readiness; no single-point-of-failure heroes.</li>
<li><strong>Well-being:</strong> Less thrash and overtime → lower burnout.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key capabilities (how we do it):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Team Strength Analysis heatmaps &amp; coverage score.</li>
<li>One-click <em>Tiger Team Builder</em> with role/skill matching.</li>
<li>Auto-generated reqs for recruiting (skills, levels, interview rubrics).</li>
<li>Personalized learning plans + employee “what I want to learn” inputs.</li>
<li>Dashboards for leaders: progress, risk, succession, and time-to-deliver.</li>
</ul>
