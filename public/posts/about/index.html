<p><strong>One-liner:</strong>
Strategen maps team skills, instantly assembles the right <em>tiger team</em> for any initiative, and guides targeted upskilling—cutting delivery time <strong>up to 50%</strong>, reducing burnout, and strengthening succession.</p>
<p><strong>30-second pitch:</strong>
Most teams don’t have a clear, current picture of their real capabilities. Strategen runs a fast Team Strength Analysis to reveal who can do what, where the coverage gaps are, and how work should be staffed. With one click, managers form <em>tiger teams</em> optimized for the mission, while recruiting gets precise role specs and employees get personalized learning paths based on goals they set. The result: faster delivery, smarter hiring, visible growth opportunities, and a more resilient organization.</p>
<p><strong>Core outcomes (what buyers remember):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed:</strong> Launch initiatives faster—often <strong>up to 50%</strong> shorter cycle times.</li>
<li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Exact skill coverage and role fit for every project.</li>
<li><strong>Growth:</strong> Targeted learning plans and employee-driven interests.</li>
<li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Succession readiness; no single-point-of-failure heroes.</li>
<li><strong>Well-being:</strong> Less thrash and overtime → lower burnout.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key capabilities (how we do it):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Team Strength Analysis heatmaps &amp; coverage score.</li>
<li>One-click <em>Tiger Team Builder</em> with role/skill matching.</li>
<li>Auto-generated reqs for recruiting (skills, levels, interview rubrics).</li>
<li>Personalized learning plans + employee “what I want to learn” inputs.</li>
<li>Dashboards for leaders: progress, risk, succession, and time-to-deliver.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="discovery-questions-use-in-first-meetings">Discovery questions (use in first meetings)</h1>
<p><strong>Current state &amp; pain</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>How are you measuring your team’s strengths and gaps today?</li>
<li>Where do initiatives slow down—scoping, handoffs, or skill coverage?</li>
<li>Which projects recently missed timelines, and why?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Coverage &amp; risk</strong>
4) If your “one critical expert” left tomorrow, what breaks?
5) Do you have a clear succession map for priority roles?</p>
<p><strong>Staffing &amp; recruiting</strong>
6) How are project teams formed now—availability, intuition, or data?
7) When you open a req, how precisely are required skills and levels defined?</p>
<p><strong>Learning &amp; engagement</strong>
8) How do employees signal what they want to learn—and does it feed staffing?
9) What % of learning spend ties to closing real, measured gaps?</p>
<p><strong>Success criteria &amp; ROI</strong>
10) If we improved time-to-deliver by 30–50%, what would that unlock?
11) Which KPIs matter most—cycle time, utilization, burnout, or retention?</p>
<p><strong>Adoption &amp; constraints</strong>
12) Who needs to see value first (leaders, managers, HR, employees)?
13) What’s the smallest pilot that would prove this works for you?</p>
