<h1 id="discovery-questions">Discovery questions:</h1>
<p><strong>Current state &amp; pain</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>How are you measuring your team’s strengths and gaps today?</li>
<li>Where do initiatives slow down—scoping, handoffs, or skill coverage?</li>
<li>Which projects recently missed timelines, and why?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Coverage &amp; risk</strong></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>If your “one critical expert” left tomorrow, what breaks?</li>
<li>Do you have a clear succession map for priority roles?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Staffing &amp; recruiting</strong></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>How are project teams formed now—availability, intuition, or data?</li>
<li>When you open a req, how precisely are required skills and levels defined?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Learning &amp; engagement</strong></p>
<ol start="8">
<li>How do employees signal what they want to learn—and does it feed staffing?</li>
<li>% of learning spend ties to closing real, measured gaps?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Success criteria &amp; ROI</strong></p>
<ol start="10">
<li>we improved time-to-deliver by 30–50%, what would that unlock?</li>
<li>KPIs matter most—cycle time, utilization, burnout, or retention?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Adoption &amp; constraints</strong></p>
<ol start="12">
<li>needs to see value first (leaders, managers, HR, employees)?
13.’s the smallest pilot that would prove this works for you?</li>
</ol>
