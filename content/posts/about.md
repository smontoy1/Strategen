Here’s a tight, ready-to-use pitch plus sharp discovery questions you can use in calls, decks, or on your site.

# Strategen — Build elite teams on demand

**One-liner:**
Strategen maps team skills, instantly assembles the right *tiger team* for any initiative, and guides targeted upskilling—cutting delivery time **up to 50%**, reducing burnout, and strengthening succession.

**30-second pitch:**
Most teams don’t have a clear, current picture of their real capabilities. Strategen runs a fast Team Strength Analysis to reveal who can do what, where the coverage gaps are, and how work should be staffed. With one click, managers form *tiger teams* optimized for the mission, while recruiting gets precise role specs and employees get personalized learning paths based on goals they set. The result: faster delivery, smarter hiring, visible growth opportunities, and a more resilient organization.

**Core outcomes (what buyers remember):**

* **Speed:** Launch initiatives faster—often **up to 50%** shorter cycle times.
* **Clarity:** Exact skill coverage and role fit for every project.
* **Growth:** Targeted learning plans and employee-driven interests.
* **Resilience:** Succession readiness; no single-point-of-failure heroes.
* **Well-being:** Less thrash and overtime → lower burnout.

**Key capabilities (how we do it):**

* Team Strength Analysis heatmaps & coverage score.
* One-click *Tiger Team Builder* with role/skill matching.
* Auto-generated reqs for recruiting (skills, levels, interview rubrics).
* Personalized learning plans + employee “what I want to learn” inputs.
* Dashboards for leaders: progress, risk, succession, and time-to-deliver.

# Discovery questions (use in first meetings)

**Current state & pain**

1. How are you measuring your team’s strengths and gaps today?
2. Where do initiatives slow down—scoping, handoffs, or skill coverage?
3. Which projects recently missed timelines, and why?

**Coverage & risk**
4\) If your “one critical expert” left tomorrow, what breaks?
5\) Do you have a clear succession map for priority roles?

**Staffing & recruiting**
6\) How are project teams formed now—availability, intuition, or data?
7\) When you open a req, how precisely are required skills and levels defined?

**Learning & engagement**
8\) How do employees signal what they want to learn—and does it feed staffing?
9\) What % of learning spend ties to closing real, measured gaps?

**Success criteria & ROI**
10\) If we improved time-to-deliver by 30–50%, what would that unlock?
11\) Which KPIs matter most—cycle time, utilization, burnout, or retention?

**Adoption & constraints**
12\) Who needs to see value first (leaders, managers, HR, employees)?
13\) What’s the smallest pilot that would prove this works for you?
