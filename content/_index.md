# Strategen — Build elite teams on demand

**About Us:**
Strategen maps team skills, instantly assembles the right *tiger team* for any initiative, and guides targeted upskilling—cutting delivery time **up to 50%**, reducing burnout, and strengthening succession.

**What we do:**
Most teams don’t have a clear, current picture of their real capabilities. Strategen runs a fast Team Strength Analysis to reveal who can do what, where the coverage gaps are, and how work should be staffed. With one click, managers form *tiger teams* optimized for the mission, while recruiting gets precise role specs and employees get personalized learning paths based on goals they set.

**The result:** faster delivery, smarter hiring, visible growth opportunities, and a more resilient organization.

**Core outcomes:**

* **Speed:** Launch initiatives faster—often **up to 50%** shorter cycle times.
* **Clarity:** Exact skill coverage and role fit for every project.
* **Growth:** Targeted learning plans and employee-driven interests.
* **Resilience:** Succession readiness; no single-point-of-failure heroes.
* **Well-being:** Less thrash and overtime → lower burnout.

**Key capabilities (how we do it):**

* Team Strength Analysis heatmaps & coverage score.
* One-click *Tiger Team Builder* with role/skill matching.
* Auto-generated reqs for recruiting (skills, levels, interview rubrics).
* Personalized learning plans + employee “what I want to learn” inputs.
* Dashboards for leaders: progress, risk, succession, and time-to-deliver.
